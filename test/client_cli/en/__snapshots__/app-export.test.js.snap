[93mImportant Note:
[39m  The [96mfrodo app[39m command to manage OAuth2 clients in v1.x has been renamed to [96mfrodo oauth client[39m in v2.x
  The [96mfrodo app[39m command in v2.x manages the new applications created using the new application templates in ForgeRock Identity Cloud. To manage oauth clients, use the [96mfrodo oauth client[39m command.

Usage Examples:
  Export all applications to a single export file with an auto-generated filename using a connection profile:
[96m  $ frodo app export -a matrix
[39m  Export the first application to a single export file with a custom filename:
[96m  $ frodo app export -f ./allMyApplications.application.json matrix
[39m  Export all applications to separate export files with an auto-generated filenames:
[96m  $ frodo app export -A matrix
[39m  Export all applications without dependencies to a single export file:
[96m  $ frodo app export --no-deps -a matrix
[39m  Export the application 'myApp' to a file with an auto-generated filename of 'myApp.application.json':
[96m  $ frodo app export -i myApp matrix
[39m
